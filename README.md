# Python-Malware-Scan----HELP
I am making a python code where I want it to scan all the sub-directories and files of my entire computer, from the root directory. Then print all the results to a scan.txt file. Then I want to pull data off a website, convert it from html to a text file. Finally i want to compare the scan.txt and malware.txt file and if there are any matches, print those matches in an output file and have an alert say, seek assistance.
